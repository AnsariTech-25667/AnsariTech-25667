Thanks for the detailed input! Based on all the projects you've listed, your GitHub username (AnsariTech-25667), and the project titles, I’ve created a complete and formatted README.md section featuring:

- Proper hyperlinks to each GitHub repository.
- Detailed descriptions.
- Integration of your LinkedIn, HackerRank, and email.
- Placeholder for an image preview (which you can replace later with actual images from your repositories).

Here is a full markdown version for your portfolio README:
